# Outline
 
For my final project, I intend to analyze the relationship between four social media platforms and  political polarization. I plan to inform the reader of political extremism that is largely found on various social media platforms, and encourage the reader to make more intentional decisions while using social media. This project will embolden viewers to advocate for better platforms that support democracy. I hope that the viewer walks away with a thorough understanding of the wide-reaching use of social media, and how it has affects our society from the individual user perspective. 

I am going to first help the viewer understand the true impact that social media has on society through a visualization depicting the total number of users for each platform I believe this step is crucial to grasping which social media platform seems to be the most powerful today. Next, I am going to create a visualization to show how often users rely on each social media platform for their primary news outlet. This step will represent how reliant our society has become on social media, especially for vital, current information. This piece of visualization will lead viewers to question if this is a positive or negative phenomenon. Lastly, I am going to create a few visualizations that reveal users' perspective on political polarization on each platform and its contribution to upholding democracy. 

For the final portion of my project, I am going to do some outside research on solutions to this growing issue. While social media produces a multitude of positive benefits to our society, there are drawbacks that we should be aware of. There are paths that can be taken to lessen political polarization. For example, an application was created in the Middle East to help foster areas of common ground. Advocating for platforms such as these will create environments that envourage inclusive and respectful discussion. 

All in all, the goal of my project is to inform the reader of social media's impact on the mdoern United States political climate and encourage them to advocate for more and better platforms that support democracy. I believe this is a peritent topic to the reader, as the reader should want to lessen the political polarization in their life and foster meaningful and inclusive conversations.

# The data
My dataset is from Pew Research Center. I plan to use Tableau and Excel to clean the data, and Tableau to display relationships between variables. My survey data is nominal categorical, so I will create new calculated fields to present each respondent's answer.

- Name: Pew Research Center
- URL: https://www.pewresearch.org/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-144/-
- Description: I found a dataset by Pew Research Center that focuses on the relationship between social media and political discourse. It is a survey containing over 10,000 respondents. There are a variety of questions given throughout the survey ranging from social media use, to news consumption on social media, to political discourse and polarization on social media. 

# Method and medium
I plan on completing my final project through Tableau and Shorthand. I will create the data visualizations on Tableau and my final presentation on Shorthand.
