# Critique By Design

## Step one: the visualization
This data visualization was extracted from the World Happiness Report. I chose this visualization for this project because I thought it was an interesting dataset and the analyses were interesting. I thought there were many ways I could use color and text to frame certain stories to the viewer. I also thought it was a good visualization to use because the data seems to be targeted toward the general public and/or political researchers. Keeping that in mind, I thought it would be fun making it easy to understand while also making it visually appealing to capture the viewer's attention.

The original data visualization was: https://public.tableau.com/views/2024Draft/Figure2_1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link 

## Step two: the critique
I thought that the data visualization was interesting and told a great story. It was a bar chart made up of over 140 countries summarizing the average ranking of happiness from survey respondents. It also featured confidence intervals of the countries, indicating the overall population's life-evaluation rating based on the survey sample. 

The primary audience for this visualization seems to be the general public or government entities. The purpose of the data is probably to help everyday people understand varying living conditions across the globe, and the policies and laws that impact quality of life. I liked that the organization organized the tabs from highest life evaluation to lowest life evaluation. I also like that they used the bar chart to visually show the rating along with a numerical description so it doesn't require a lot of eye travel to interpret the information. However, I think there are many areas where this visualization could be improved.

Firstly, I think the overwhelming amount of bars sways viewers from reading the chart. Throwing large amounts of information overloads the reader, especially if the reader is an everyday civilian. I think the visualization could benefit from narrowing down the number of bars displayed. I also think the color choices are quite boring and arbitrary. I think there is another way to use color that will make it both visually interesting and purposeful. Lastly, I think that adding the confidence intervals directly on the bars makes it difficult to read and distracting. The text overlaps between the blue bar and the white background. I do not think this information is necessary, considering who the target audience is.

For my redesign, I am going to take advantage of color and group country regions together. In the analysis, it discussed how a majority of the top twenty countries are European. I thought that color would be a great way of depicting that. I am also going to remove the confidence intervals from the bars because I do not think they are necessary to telling the story to the general public. However, since they could be useful to researchers, I am going to include them in the visualization as a hover feature. The current visualization's confidence intervals create confusion and clash with the background colors. By removing this unnecessary information, it will bring clarity, cleanliness, and readibility to the visualization.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions I asked my Interviewees:
- Without reading about this visualization, can you infer what it is trying to tell?
- What do you think about the color choices?
- Does this visualization peak your interest and make you want to learn more about the topic?
- Is there anything I should do differently?

Results: 

Interview 1:
- Interviewee 1 thought the visualization did a good job displaying the story it was trying to tell. It was very clear and made great use of color. The color made it visually appealing and led the interviewee to ask more questions. The interviewee thought that there were too many bar on the bar chart. They suggested to narrow down to the top twenty countries, or display both the top twenty and bottom twenty.

Interview 2:
- Interviewee 2 thought the visualization was interesting, especially since they are excited about anything that deals with international data and social policy. They thought that the regional colors were a great touch. However, they pointed out that many of the countries were incorrectly labeled by region. Aside from this issue, they thought the visualization was effective. I followed up with the first interviewee's concern, and asked if I should find a way to delete some of the bars. The interviewee thought that the visualization was interesting and easy to interpret regardless of the number of bars. 

Interview 3: 
- Interviewee 3 liked the visualization, thought it was easy to understand without additional context, and appreciated the use of color. However, they also thought there were too many bars, creating confusion. They suggested finding a way to limit the number of bars on the page so it would fit on one screen. 

Synthesis: 
The three viewers seemed to agree that my decision to group the bars by region was a good idea. They thought that the color made it easy to infer which regions had the happiest citizens, and it led them to want to learn more about the topic. A frequent critique about the visualization was the number of bars on the visualization. They thought that it would be less overwhelming for everyday viewers, and would tell the same story regardless of the amount of data on the visualization.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
