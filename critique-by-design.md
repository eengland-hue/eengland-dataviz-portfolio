# Critique By Design

## Step one: the visualization
This data visualization was extracted from the World Happiness Report. I chose this visualization for this project because I found the dataset and its analyses interesting. I saw many opportunities where color and text could be used to frame specific stories for the viewer. I also thought it was a good visualization to use because the data seems to be targeted toward the general public and/or political researchers. With that in mind, I wanteed to make it both easy to understand and visually appealing to capture the viewer's attention.

## Step two: the critique
I thought that the data visualization told a great story. It is a bar chart representing over 140 countries, summarizing the average ranking of happiness from survey respondents. It also featured confidence intervals, indicating the overall population's life-evaluation rating based on the survey sample. 

The primary audience for this visualization appears to be the general public or government entities. I believe the purpose of the data is to help everyday people understand people's perceived happiness levels across countries, and encourage relection on the policies and laws that influence quality of life. I liked that the organization sorted the tabs from highest life evaluation to lowest life evaluation. I also like that they used the bar chart to visually show the rating along with a numerical description, minimizing the efford needed to interpret the information. However, I think there are several areas where this visualization could be improved.

Firstly, the overwhelming number of bars sways viewers from reading the chart. Presenting large amounts of information overloads the audience, especially when it is intended for everyday individuals. I think the visualization could benefit from narrowing down the number of bars displayed. Additionally also think the color choices are quite dull and arbitrary. I think there is another way to use color that will make it both visually interesting and purposeful. Lastly, I think that adding the confidence intervals directly on the bars makes it difficult to read and visually distracting. The text overlaps between the blue bar and the white background. I do not think this information is necessary, considering who the target audience is.

For my redesign, I am going to take advantage of color and group country regions together. In the analysis, it discussed how a majority of the top twenty countries are European. I thought that color would be a great way of highlighting this insight. I am also going to remove the confidence intervals from the bars because I do not think they are necessary to telling the story to the general public. However, since they could be useful to researchers, I am going to include them in the visualization as a hover feature. The current visualization's confidence intervals create confusion and clash with the background colors. By removing this unnecessary information, it will bring clarity, cleanliness, and readibility to the visualization.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions I asked my Interviewees:
- Without reading about this visualization, can you infer what it is trying to tell?
- What do you think about the color choices?
- Does this visualization peak your interest and make you want to learn more about the topic?
- Is there anything I should do differently?

Results: 

Interview 1:
- Interviewee 1 thought the visualization did a good job displaying the story it was trying to tell. It was very clear and made great use of color. The color made it visually appealing and led the interviewee to ask more questions. The interviewee thought that there were too many bars on the bar chart. They suggested to narrow down to the top twenty countries, or display both the top twenty and bottom twenty.

Interview 2:
- Interviewee 2 thought the visualization was interesting, especially since they are excited about anything that deals with international data and social policy. They thought that the regional colors were a great touch. However, they pointed out that many of the countries were incorrectly labeled by region. Aside from this issue, they thought the visualization was effective. I followed up with the first interviewee's concern, and asked if I should find a way to delete some of the bars. The interviewee thought that the visualization was interesting and easy to interpret regardless of the number of bars. 

Interview 3: 
- Interviewee 3 liked the visualization, thought it was easy to understand without additional context, and appreciated the use of color. However, they also thought there were too many bars, creating confusion. They suggested finding a way to limit the number of bars on the page so it would fit on one screen. 

Synthesis: 
The three viewers seemed to agree that my decision to group the bars by region was a good idea. They thought that the color made it easy to infer which regions had the happiest citizens, and it led them to want to learn more about the topic. A frequent critique about the visualization was the number of bars on the visualization. They thought that it would be less overwhelming for everyday viewers, and would tell the same story regardless of the amount of data on the visualization.

## Step five: build the solution

For my final solution, I corrected each country’s regional classification to accurately reflect their geographic regions. I also refined the visualization by displaying only the top twenty and bottom twenty countries, highlighting those with the happiest and least happy citizens. I think that this version of the visualization is easier to interpret and limits eye travel between bars. The visualization still tells intriquing information that will continue to peak the readers interest, without too much overwhelming information.
