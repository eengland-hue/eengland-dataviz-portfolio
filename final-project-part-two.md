# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience for this project is the general public and those that use social media. The goal of this project is to inform the reader of social media's impact on news consumption, and encourage them to make more intentional choices when consuming information. 

## Interview script

Goal 1: Decide what my call to action is.
Question: What questions does this project lead you to ask? Are you more interested in learning about reliable and truthful news sources or how to combat these platforms' polariizing algorithms? 

Goal 2: Find other potential areas that can be addressed in this project to fill in gaps.
Question: Are any of the visualizations confusing or could they answer better questions relevant to the topic of the project?

Goal 3: Develop a story narrative for my target audience.
Question 3: Are there places that this can be a more effective story narrative for my audience?
