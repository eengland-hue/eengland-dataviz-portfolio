>Section 1 - Introduction
>
>Political extremism and social media: This is where I will do some outside research about political extremism and its relation to social media.

>Section 2 - The Data
>
> This section will feature several visualizations explaining the number of users on each platform and their experiences with news consumption and political discourse. My visualizations will explain the overall number of users on each platform, how often they get news from the platform, the platform's news accuracy and algorithmic influence, and the platform's support of democracy.

>Section 3 - Escaping the algorithm
>
>This section will require some outside research about media literacy and escaping social media addiction.

>Section 4 - Call to action
>
>Practical ways to break free of the echo chamber of negative thoughts related to social media.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience for this project is people that frequently find themselves in a never-ending loop consuming media. While social media is beneficial in many ways to society, it also creates major drawbacks to those that become addicted to social media and develop toxic thought patterns.

## Interview script
The goal of my research and interview process is to decide what my call to action is and any missing data that could fill in gaps for viewers. 

Goal 1: Decide what my call to action is.
>Question: What questions does this project lead you to ask? Are you more interested in learning more about reliable and truthful news sources or how to combat these platforms' polariizing algorithms? 

Goal 2: Find potential gaps that can be addressed in this project.
>Question: Are any of the visualizations confusing or could they answer better questions relevant to the topic of the project?

Goal 3: Develop a story narrative for my target audience.
>Question 3: Are there places where this can be a more effective story narrative?

## Interview findings
QUESTIONS

>Question 3: Are there any gaps or places that will make this a more effective story narrative?

INTERVIEWS
Interview 1, Entry Data Analyst 22 Female
>Question 1 Answer: Noticed that different users felt like the platform didn't support democracy. Curious about if Instagram is legitimately better for democracy and if Facebook users are more likely to fall into an echochamber. Raises questions about media literacy and alleviating illiteracy on social media.

>Question 2 Answer: The second graphic was less memorable. Change the presentation style of the graphic. The data itself was interesting but some edits can be done to make it more engaging.

>Question 3 Answer: Showing some information about each social media's algorithms instead of just survey data. Find data on how sensitive each algorithm is to user actions. 

Interview 2, Graduate Student 23 Female
>Question 1 Answer: Encourage people to do more outside research and think critically when consuming information. This interviewee thought that the call to action should be more focused on user action that the platforms' to be more effective.

>Question 2 Answer: Adding the total count of people that took the survey understand the scope of the data.

>Question 3 Answer: If it's possible, some data on the rise of political extremism overtime since the rise of social media.

Interview 3, Graduate Student 23 Female
>Question 1 Answer: Go to news sources outside of social media, especially since social media can impact what content you consume. ONLY using social media will lead to people neglecting current world events and developing a false sense of reality.

>Question 2 Answer: Visualizations were visually easy to look at and understand.

>Question 3 Answer: Source of the data and the age range of the data would be interesting to know since some of the platforms that had the most user engagement were surprising.


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| My interviewees seemed ot be more interested in how people should combat the spread of misinformation and disinformation.They thought it would be more impactful to use a call to action that emphasizes user actions rather than platform accountability.| My call to action for this project will be to encourage social media users to think critically about the information they consume and to check the sources of each article before sharing.|
|Two out of three of my interviewees did not remember the content of the second visualization I had drafted.| Reevaluate the visualization type and colors to make the graphic more memorable and impactful. I am also going to change the data type for the visualization from counts to percentages.|
|This projcet led my interveiwees to question more, specifically about media literacy and social media algorithms.|                                                 I am going to do some more outside research and seek out additional resources that help viewers understand the power of social media algorithms and the importance of having strong media literacy in today's climate.|
