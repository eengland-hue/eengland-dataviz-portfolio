# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
For my final story, I decided to transition my focus and call to action from social media platforms' role in our political sphere to how these platforms affect users' mental health. I chose to narrow down the issue to users' ability to decipher between real and fake news, and platforms' natural tendency to isolate them from diverse perspectives. I think that this shift created a more cohesive story. I also decided for my calls to action to be mental health focused, so I not only included a way for users to seek out various news sources, but other methods to protect their mental health from addictive algorithms.

## The audience
For my audience, I decided to narrow it down to social media users that are vulnerable to falling into echo chambers. My statistic, "1 in 3 users have felt worn out by the news they see on social media," was a compelling fact that I found through my data analysis. I think this was a great way to introduce my story amd shift the focus toward user mental health and away from platform algorithms. Since I shifted toward mental health, I removed a few visualizations such as platforms and their influence on democracy. I did not find this visualization necessary, and it made it more difficult to tell a cohesive story. I think one of my main issues while developing this story was developing the story around the visualizations, when I should have been creating visualizations to tell a story.

For my final design, I wanted to keep the theme dark with bright features that are similar to the platforms' signature colors. For example, most of my color pallette was red, blue, and purple since users associate these colors with  TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. I also took advantage of Shorthand's media and scrollmation features. I used videos from Pexels to engage the reader and bring some dimension into the story.

# Final thoughts
> In the beginning I had trouble flushing out a solid story. After looking at other stories, I realized I was trying to tell a story with my visualizations rather than using my visualizations to tell a story. I was too focused on putting more data in the story instead of only adding the appropriate data that made sense. If I could do this story again, I would like to find a dataset that investigates social media's impact overtime. I think this would tell a more thorough story, and flush out the message.
